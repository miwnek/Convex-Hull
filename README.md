# Implementation and visualization of convex hull algorithms

## Description
This repository contains a project written in Python, made for the Geometric Algorithms course at AGH University in Kraków. The main objective was to implement and create a visualization for following algorithms:
- Jarvis'
- Grahams'
- Chan's
- Divide and Conquer
- Upper-lower hull
- Quickhull
- Increment
## Use
To use algorithms implemented by us, include this line in your python file:
```
from convexhulls import *
```
Running the code requires modules:
- matplotlib
- NumPy

For more detailed description, see the decumentation in Polish.
## Example
A gif made from slides, generated by **main.py**,  visualizing the Divide And Conquer algorithm for computing convex hulls:
