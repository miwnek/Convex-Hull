# Implementation and visualization of convex hull algorithms

## Description
This repository contains a project written in Python made for the Geometric Algorithms course at AGH University in Kraków. The main objective was to implement and create a visualization for following algorithms:

- Jarvis'
- Grahams'
- Chan's
- Divide and Conquer
- Upper-lower hull
- Quickhull
- Increment

## Use
To use algorithms implemented by us, include this line in your python file:
```
from convexhulls import * ```

For more detailed description see the decumentation in Polish.
